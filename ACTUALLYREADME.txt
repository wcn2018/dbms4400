Quick description of the stack:

React for front end stuff: text boxes, standard web shit
React interfaces with express: express uses nodejs to create valid javascript
interaction between front and backend.
express also utilizes the mysql wrapper (different from actual mysql), to send queries between javascript and mysql.
mysql uses these queries to query the database.
all this info then propogates up.

NEED TO:
- Install nodejs
- Install npm (the package manager for node)
This should work on mac: sudo apt-get install npm
- pull the repository
- Install ndoemon globally to run server tests (maybe optional)

NOTE: Expresswrapper is horribly named, this is all the nodejs dependencies and the backend. I can't change it now tho.
